\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclustion}

From the discussion described in the previous section,
  it was found that by using the proposed system, a robot, especially SARs,
  can be developed and tested both in a simulation environment using a virtual robot and in the real world using a real robot.
With this, robot development will be easier to do, more cost-effective,
  and safer to be tested on users because it can be developed virtually in a simulation environment,
  while not leaving the ability to also be tested on a real robot.
