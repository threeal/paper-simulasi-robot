\label{subsec:ros2}

Robot Operating System (ROS) \citep{quigley2009} is a collection of libraries, drivers,
  and tools that facilitate system development on robots.
ROS has Linux like command tools,
  interprocess communication systems, and various packages related to system development on robots.

Processes that are executed on ROS are referred to as nodes,
  communication between each processes uses the publish/subscribe model,
  and the communication data sent between processes is referred to as a topic.
A publisher process can submit one or more topics,
  then other processes that subscribe to that topic could get the contents of that topic.
In addition, there is also a service that has a function like a topic,
  but it's done in two-ways direction.
This service works by using a client/server model where a service client could send request data in the form of a service request and then a service server will send reply data in the form of a service response.

The second generation of Robot Operating System, ROS 2,
  is a continuation of ROS that brings reliability and performance for real-time use while still supporting the advantages of the previous ROS \citep{maruyama2016}.
To meet the reliability and performance requirements for real-time use,
  ROS 2 uses Data Distribution Service (DDS) \citep{castellote2003} \citep{schlesselman2004},
  the industry standard for real-time communication systems and end-to-end middleware,
  which replaces the previous ROS's interprocess communication system.
