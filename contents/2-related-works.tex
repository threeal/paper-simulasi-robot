Several previous studies have been successful in developing a simulated environment for robots using ROS (the predecessor of ROS 2) and Gazebo.
As done by \citet{qian2014} who developed simulations for manipulator robots,
   \citet{zhang2015} who developed simulations for UAV quadrotor robots,
   and \citet{takaya2016} who developed simulation environments for mobile robots testing.
However, in contrast to previous research,
  the research that we have done chooses to use ROS 2 so that the robot controller made for simulation has better performance and can work in real-time \citep{maruyama2016}.

In addition,
  other research has also been carried out by \citet{erickson2020} who developed Assistive Gym,
  a simulation framework for assistive robotics based on OpenAI Gym.
That simulation framework was then used by \citet{clegg2020} to develop learning methods through simulations for collaboration between robots and humans in helping humans wear clothes.
However, because it does not use ROS,
  the robot controller created for simulation using that framework needs to be redeveloped when it will be tested directly on users using real robots.
Nevertheless, research conducted by \citet{zamora2016} shows that the simulation in OpenAI Gym can also be integrated into ROS and Gazebo,
  so it is possible that Assistive Gym can also be used in conjunction with ROS 2 and Gazebo.
