\label{subsec:gazebo}

Gazebo \citep{koenig2004} is a part of the Player Project \citep{gerkey2003} that allows a robot simulation and sensor application to work in a three-dimensional indoor or outdoor simulation environment.
Gazebo has a client/server architecture and a publish/subscribe model for the communication system between processes.
Each simulation object in the Gazebo can be associated with one or more controllers that will process commands to set and determine the state of an object.
Data generated by a controller will be sent to shared memory using Gazebo interfaces (ifaces).
Later, ifaces from other processes can read the data in shared memory,
  thus enabling inter-process communication between the program that controls the robot and the Gazebo simulator,
  regardless of the programming language used.
